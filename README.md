# Sum Limit Instructions  
```md 
  Given an input string, count the number of words ending
  in 'y' or 'z' -so the 'y' in "heavy" and the 'z' in "fez"
  count, but not the 'y' in "yellow".
 *
   Make sure that your comparison is not case sensitive.
   We'll say that a 'y' or 'z' is at the end of a word
   if there is not an alphabetic letter immediately following it.
 *
   Do not use any string functions except for substr(),
   at(), and size(), and isalpha() from <cctype>.
 *
   This is the most difficult problem in the set,
   so do not start with this one.
 *
   Here are some other examples:
    - "fez day" -> 2
    - "day fez" -> 2
    - "day fyyyz" -> 2
```
